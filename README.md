# Directory structure

The directory structure of a Shared Library repository is as follows:

```
(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar
```


The `src` directory should look like standard Java source directory structure. This directory is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines.

The `vars` directory hosts script files that are exposed as a variable in Pipelines. The name of the file is the name of the variable in the Pipeline. So if you had a file called vars/log.groovy with a function like def info(message)…​ in it, you can access this function like log.info "hello world" in the Pipeline. You can put as many functions as you like inside this file. Read on below for more examples and options.

The basename of each `.groovy` file should be a Groovy (~ Java) identifier, conventionally `camelCased`. The matching `.txt`, if present, can contain documentation, processed through the system’s configured markup formatter (so may really be HTML, Markdown, etc., though the `.txt` extension is required). This documentation will only be visible on the Global Variable Reference pages that are accessed from the navigation sidebar of Pipeline jobs that import the shared library. In addition, those jobs must run successfully once before the shared library documentation will be generated.

A `resources` directory allows the libraryResource step to be used from an external library to load associated non-Groovy files. Currently this feature is not supported for internal libraries.

Other directories under the root are reserved for future enhancements.


## Library Setup

You can define a shared library within a Jenkinsfile, or you can configure the library using the Jenkins web console. It’s better to add from the web console, because you then you can share the library across all of your build jobs.

To add your shared library:

1. In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins → Configure System. Under Global Pipeline Libraries, add a library with the following settings:
    ```
    Name: custom-pipeline-library
    Default version: Specify a Git reference (branch or commit SHA), e.g. master
    Retrieval method: Modern SCM
    Select the Git type
    Project repository: https://github.com/frvasquezjaquez/custom-jenkins-library.git
    ```
